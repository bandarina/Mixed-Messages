# Mixed-Messages

## Assignment description
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project objectives
- _Build a message generator program using JavaScript_
- _Use Git version control_
- _Use command line_
- _Develop locally on your computer_

## Project prerequisites
- _JavaScript_
- _Git and GitHub_
- _Command line_

## How have I taken the idea one step forward?
1. I've built an interface for the program using HTML and CSS knowledge.
2. I've made that design responsive.
3. I've replaced the randomly generated output with custom replies according to a user's input.
4. I incorporated an API.
